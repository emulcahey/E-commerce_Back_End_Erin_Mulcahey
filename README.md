# E-commerce Back End Starter Code

## Description

My goal in building this application was to build the back end for an e-commerce site. I took a working Express.js API and configured it to use Sequelize to interact with a PostgreSQL database. I wanted to learn how to use pgAdmin and Postgres to handle and change data for an application. This also was a way for me to connect these different programs and learn how they function together. 

## Installation

To use this program, the user will need to: -Clone this repository. And, open the repository from the installed folder. -Access the integrated terminal and install npm to use the repository. -type 'node server.js' into the integrated terminal. -type answers to the prompts that the programs gives the user.

## Usage

A user can use this program to help them handle data from multiple tables. This application allows the user to add, edit, and delete items within the tables. A user can choose to create data, edit data, delete data, or view all the data in multiple ways.
